    <li><p>Leadership is not about a title or a designation. Its about impact, influence, and inspiration. Impact involves getting results, influence is about spreading the passion you have for your work, and you have to inspire teammates. Without a doubt, Dir. Mahesh, Principal of Helicopter International School is the most scrupulous leader as it is under her tutelage that every day thousands of minds are inspired and educated. He is indeed a true personification of leadership as he believes in assimilating a powerful value system in the students along with focusing on their academic and co-curricular excellence. For the overall development of the students, he has worked hard to open varied promenades for trailing perfection in talent areas, like Visual & Performing Arts, Sports & Games, Life Skills, etc. Thus, it is in the honor of this distinction that Dir. Mahesh was bestowed with the title ‘Principal Par Excellence’ by the leading the International Institute of Hotel Management (IIHM).</p></li>
    <li><p>A teacher is one of the individuals who play a significant role in shaping the future of a child.

Over the last 5 years, the event has become most sought after and popular among the educators of the country and is now India’s biggest award. This award certainly merits and symbolizes the conscientious Teaching fraternity of Helicopter International School. </p></li>
