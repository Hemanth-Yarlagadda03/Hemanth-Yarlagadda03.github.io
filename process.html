		<h1 class="st">Steps in the Admission Process</h1>
		<p class="t">
		<b>1) Shadowing visit (Not applicable during summer months)</b><br><br>
        The student visits the school for one full day, and then schedules a second visit at the recommendation of the teachers 
        and admissions team. The student will be shadowing one or two students during the day as they attend classes. Parents 
        schedule a meeting with our Business Director during the first visit.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2) Parent interview</b><br>
        The parent interview occurs during the first visiting day with the Admissions Coordinator and the Business Director. The
        interview provides a chance for the family to ask in-depth questions about being a part of the school. Parents are a critical
        part of our school community. If a student is admitted, parents are asked to sign a contract regarding fundraising and 
        participation in our governance system. We look forward to working with both parents and their children.<br>
        <br>
        <b>3) Application</b><br>
        If the admissions coordinator, teaching team, student, and parents decide to move forward with the application, then the 
        formal process begins. Parents and student complete and submit the application within the Blackbaud myschool app. In 
        addition to the application, a copy of the student’s current transcripts and two letters of recommendation are required
        (at least one by a teacher). Once all materials are received, the application is considered complete.<br>
        <br>
        <b>4) Applicant-Teacher Interview</b><br>
        The student is formally interviewed by a member of the teaching staff. We focus on students as quality and collaborative
        workers and on their ability to become active citizens in our school community. Because of this we ask that students bring
        examples of work that they are proud of or that illustrate activities or subjects they are passionate about. Examples include,
        but are not limited to, work that showcases academic or artistic work, group projects, sports, community service, travel 
        experience, dance, theater and any other areas the student is passionate about.<br>
        <br>
        <b>5) Faculty review and Interviews</b><br>
        The application, references, and transcripts are reviewed by the admissions coordinator and teaching staff to determine if the
        school can meet the academic needs of the student. If the teachers feel TNS is a good fit for the student, the family is notified
        that they are accepted for enrollment. If the teachers do not feel they can meet the student’s needs, the process ends and the
        family is notified by the Admissions Coordinator.<br>
        <br>
        <b>6) Next steps upon admission</b><br>
        The family completes the contract and sets up their tuition account within our online system. There is a non-refundable deposit 
        of <b><span>&#8377;</span>2000</b> required at the time of signing. The deposit is applied to tuition. Families may also apply  for financial
        aid at that time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>7) Enrollment</b><br>
        Upon enrollment, there is a three month trial period to see if the school meets the student’s needs, and to assess if the student
        is meeting the Student Agreements and the family is fulfilling the terms of the Enrollment Contract. After three months the 
        student is either accepted fully to the school, given an extended trial period, or asked to leave the school.<br>
