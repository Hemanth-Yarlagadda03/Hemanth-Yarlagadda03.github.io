		<h1 class="st">Steps in the Admission Process</h1>
		<p class="t">
		<b>1) Shadowing visit (Not applicable during summer months)</b><br>
        The student visits the school for one full day, and then schedules a second visit at the recommendation of the teachers <br>
        and admissions team. The student will be shadowing one or two students during the day as they attend classes. Parents <br>
        schedule a meeting with our Business Director during the first visit.<br>
        <br>
        <b>2) Parent interview</b><br>
        The parent interview occurs during the first visiting day with the Admissions Coordinator and the Business Director. The<br>
        interview provides a chance for the family to ask in-depth questions about being a part of the school. Parents are a critical<br>
        part of our school community. If a student is admitted, parents are asked to sign a contract regarding fundraising and <br>
        participation in our governance system. We look forward to working with both parents and their children.<br>
        <br>
        <b>3) Application</b><br>
        If the admissions coordinator, teaching team, student, and parents decide to move forward with the application, then the <br>
        formal process begins. Parents and student complete and submit the application within the Blackbaud myschool app. In <br>
        addition to the application, a copy of the student’s current transcripts and two letters of recommendation are required <br>
        (at least one by a teacher). Once all materials are received, the application is considered complete.<br>
        <br>
        <b>4) Applicant-Teacher Interview</b><br>
        The student is formally interviewed by a member of the teaching staff. We focus on students as quality and collaborative <br>
        workers and on their ability to become active citizens in our school community. Because of this we ask that students bring<br>
        examples of work that they are proud of or that illustrate activities or subjects they are passionate about. Examples include,<br>
        but are not limited to, work that showcases academic or artistic work, group projects, sports, community service, travel <br>
        experience, dance, theater and any other areas the student is passionate about.<br>
        <br>
        <b>5) Faculty review and Interviews</b><br>
        The application, references, and transcripts are reviewed by the admissions coordinator and teaching staff to determine if the<br>
        school can meet the academic needs of the student. If the teachers feel TNS is a good fit for the student, the family is notified<br>
        that they are accepted for enrollment. If the teachers do not feel they can meet the student’s needs, the process ends and the<br>
        family is notified by the Admissions Coordinator.<br>
        <br>
        <b>6) Next steps upon admission</b><br>
        The family completes the contract and sets up their tuition account within our online system. There is a non-refundable deposit <br>
        of <b><span>&#8377;</span>2000</b> required at the time of signing. The deposit is applied to tuition. Families may also apply  for financial<br>
        aid at that time.<br>
        <br>
        <b>7) Enrollment</b><br>
        Upon enrollment, there is a three month trial period to see if the school meets the student’s needs, and to assess if the student<br>
        is meeting the Student Agreements and the family is fulfilling the terms of the Enrollment Contract. After three months the <br>
        student is either accepted fully to the school, given an extended trial period, or asked to leave the school.<br>
