          <h2>Advantages of IB over CBSE, ICSE and State boards</h2>  

           <h3>Is IB better than CBSE and ICSE?</h3> 


           Boards in India like CBSE and ICSE are always theory orientated. Students of these boards read from books, memorize the answers and get good marks.

            On the other hand, IB board is very versatile and practical oriented. Students learn things by doing practical. Also the wide spectrum of subjects ensures that the student can make all round development.

            Also teachers don't depend on books in IB schools.
            Also since IB board is accepted world wide; it gives more opportunities for the student to explore.
