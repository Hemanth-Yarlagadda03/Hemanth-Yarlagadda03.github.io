            <p style="text-align: center;">BDSN is one of the few schools that goes beyond academics, 
                catering to students’ signature strengths.     <br>
                Here arts, crafts, music, dance, drama and sports are given as much importance as academics. <br>
                The Leadership Curriculum is unique to Indus. It allows students to set competency-based goals in several areas. <br>
                We believe that competency development is essential to creativity and being startup ready in life.   <br>
                All of these aspects provide for Whole Education. The Innovation Curriculum, Indus Orchestra and Choir, <br>
                Innovation Council, House Visions, Community Service Projects, inter-school tournaments and inter-house competitions are <br>
                just some of the opportunities provided to students. Through these features, <br>
                we aim to teach skills that would prepare students for the VUCA world that lies ahead of them.   <br>       
                We firmly believe in providing holistic education, but not at the cost of academic excellence    <br>

            <h2>THE BDSN STARTUP SCHOOL</h2>
            <p>
                The BDSN Startup School is the first of its kind within K-12 education globally, <br>
                where students of Grades 9 to 12 pursue a twinning/dual program, <br>
                committing to 4 hours a week at the Startup School. <br>
                Students work in teams to develop competencies in the following avenues: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leadership</li>
                    <li>Life</li>
                    <li>Business</li>
                    <li>Technology</li>
                </ul>
                The curriculum aims at guiding students on how to think, learn, and reflect   <br>
                on their learning in order to promote student autonomy.  <br>
                A unique feature of the Startup School is the involvement of some parents  <br>
                as mentors, who guide and coach students in the development of business competencies. <br> 
                This parent-school partnership highlights the paradigm shift in 21st-century education <br>
                and its importance in unlocking the potential of a student. <br>

            <h2>COMMUNITY SERVICE AND INITIATIVES</h2>
            <p>
                We encourage our students to contribute to the planning and rollout of various <br>
                initiatives related to community service. BDSN International School Hyderabad (IISH) <br> 
                hosts an annual fixture called ‘Insignia’, which is an annual philanthropic carnival. <br>
                In the prior years, we have raised funds to execute the following projects:  <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Building a Primary School in Kondakal Village</li>
                    <li>Setting up a Library at Kondakal Secondary School</li>
                    <li>Setting up an ICT Lab at Kondakal Secondary School</li>
                    <li>Installing an Areca leaf plate making unit, <br>
                        contributing to women empowerment.  <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                In 2019, we started a ‘community kitchen’ catering to the children of migrant <br>
                workers employed at various construction sites in the vicinity of our school. <br>
                A survey conducted by us indicated that the bulk of these families had travelled <br>
                to Hyderabad from faraway places, in search of livelihoods. However, despite <br>
                securing employment they lacked basic amenities such as education for their <br>
                children, recreational activity, hygiene, sanitation, water and nutritious food.  <br>
                We therefore set out a programme with the following priorities, and have <br>
                established excellent progress: <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Offering basic education to the children and keeping them engaged.</li>
                    <li>A free midday meal for approximately one hundred children.</li>
                </ul>
                We plan on scaling up the intervention to include hygiene, sanitation <br>
                and the provision of potable water.  <br>
            </p>

            <h2>BDSN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY SCHOOL</h2>  

            <p>>BDSN International Community School is an equal opportunity school as it provides  <br>
            the same learning facilities to underprivileged children that privileged children receive. <br> 
            The school started its operations on June 21st 2010. This school caters to education for <br>
            underprivileged children from Grade 1 to 10. <br>
            BICS follows a curriculum similar to the IB PYP curriculum from 1st to 5th grade and the  <br> 
            Karnataka State Board from 6th to 10th. The curriculum places emphasis on English, Technology, <br> 
            and Leadership Skills. It also helps develop vocational skills in areas such as  <br>
            Computer-Aided Design (CAD); Animation & Graphics; Filmmaking, Photography, etc.  <br>
            Apart from the learning at school, BICS students actively participate in volunteering  <br>
            service for food preparation and distribution at the BDSN Community Kitchen and mobile <br>
            library through the ‘Agents of Change’ program. BICS also has Remote Learning Centers (RLCs) <br> 
            in village clusters to support children with their homework, and to provide functional <br>
            literacy-coaching to parents. In addition to team sports that are fairly common, BICS also provides <br>
            opportunities for international sports like equestrian, golf, swimming and karate. With rigorous coaching <br>
            in target sports, balanced with strong academics, the school creates a platform for holistic education. <br>
